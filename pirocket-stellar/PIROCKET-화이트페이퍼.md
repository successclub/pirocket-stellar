### 6.4 Quantum Computing Preparedness

**The Quantum Threat**

As quantum computing technology advances, traditional cryptographic systems used in many cryptocurrencies may become vulnerable to quantum attacks. Quantum computers have the potential to break current cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), which could compromise the security of digital assets.

**PIROCKET's Quantum Defense Strategy**

PIROCKET is committed to protecting our community's assets from future quantum computing threats:

1. **Current Security Foundation**: PIROCKET utilizes Stellar's Ed25519 signature scheme, which provides strong security against current classical computing attacks and offers a better foundation for quantum-resistant transitions than older cryptographic systems.

2. **Future-Proofing Roadmap**: We are actively monitoring developments in quantum-resistant cryptography and are prepared to migrate to quantum-resistant algorithms when they become standardized and adopted by the Stellar network.

3. **Proactive Security Measures**: PIROCKET will implement quantum-resistant security measures ahead of widespread quantum computing threats, ensuring our community's assets remain secure in the quantum era.

4. **Network-Level Protection**: As part of the Stellar ecosystem, PIROCKET benefits from Stellar's commitment to security and will automatically inherit any quantum-resistant upgrades implemented at the network level.

5. **Community Awareness**: We believe in keeping our community informed about security developments and will provide transparent updates about our quantum-resistant security measures.

**Why This Matters**

Quantum computing represents both an opportunity and a challenge for the cryptocurrency industry. While quantum computers promise incredible computational power, they also pose a potential threat to current cryptographic security. PIROCKET is positioned as a forward-thinking cryptocurrency that prepares for this future, ensuring that our holders' assets remain secure long-term.

**Our Commitment**

PIROCKET is more than just a meme coin—it's a cryptocurrency built with the future in mind. By preparing for quantum computing threats today, we ensure that PIROCKET remains a secure and viable asset as technology evolves.
